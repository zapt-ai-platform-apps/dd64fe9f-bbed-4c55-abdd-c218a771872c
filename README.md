# Status Tracker App

An app where mobile professionals like hairdressers or any other profession that goes to clients' houses regularly can add themselves to the app and update their status throughout the day. Their clients can check their status whenever they want. Clients can press refresh to get the latest delay time (e.g., 10 minutes). This app is not for storing professionals' diaries; it is just their 'status'.
